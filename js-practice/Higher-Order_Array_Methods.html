    <title>Higher-Order Array Methods (Filter, Map, Reduce)
    </title>

    <h3>Key Concepts: Using these methods to manipulate arrays.
    </h3>
    <h1>Task 1: Use filter to extract only even numbers from an array. <br>
        Task 2: Use map to create a new array with all elements squared. <br>
        Task 3: Use reduce to calculate the total sum of elements in an array. <br>
        Challenge: Combine filter, map, and reduce to get the sum of squares of even numbers from an array.
